This is ai-assistant system for any interview online.
This system helps interviewees win interviews by automatically showing chatgpt's answers to the interviewer's questions.
This system assumes that the interviewee uses two PCs for the interview. One PC hosts the video chat channel with the interviewee. The other monitors the interviewee in real time using a remote management tool like AnyDesk or TightVNC. The system is divided into a backend and a frontend, with the backend running on the first PC and the frontend running on the second PC.
